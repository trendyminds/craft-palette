‚å®Ô∏è CMD+K your way around Craft!

## ü§î What is Palette?

Palette allows you to easily jump between areas, entries, assets, and users within Craft without lifting your hands off the keyboard!

If you're a developer, you likely use something like [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), or [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/search-with-spotlight-mchlp1008/mac).

That should also exist in the CMS you use most, right? With Palette you can now jump around with ease!
